# jQuery-TH-Float

[See Full Write-Up](http://rommelsantor.com/clog/2011/03/03/th-float-jquery-plugin-fixed-thead-tfoot-table/)

I wrote this jQuery plugin a few years ago when the need arose to keep the THEAD and/or TFOOT of very tall data tables in view so the user could have some idea which column header/footer belong to which data column while scrolling.
